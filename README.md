# LostAndFoundPortal
## Project Generated for Hackbyte 2022

This is a Frontend Interface for a lost and found website generated for our college which includes frontend and UI for authorisation and listing of lost and find items in the college to prevent cluttering of lost and found mails in everyone's inbox.

## Technologies used: 
1. HTML
1. CSS 
1. Bootstrap

## Planned Working: 
- User creates and account through Google and makes a profile with contact details
- A User can make a listing for an item they have found or have lost and details of where they lost/found it.
- A User who has lost an item can go and check in the list for that item and make a claim for that item.

## Todos and Future Requirements:
- [ ] Firebase Authorisation feature using google
- [ ] Implementing Firebase database feature for storing the list of the lost and found items.
